# ccgauge marketing site

The product website at `ccgauge.dev` (and on whichever static host you
deploy this to). Built with [Astro 4](https://astro.build) + Tailwind v3,
bilingual (English + 简体中文), with full dark/light theme support and
zero JS framework runtime.

This directory is **source-only**. Commands and dependencies live in the repo
root `package.json`, and the site uses the root `node_modules` and root
`pnpm-lock.yaml`. The site is still excluded from the npm tarball via the main
repo's `package.json#files` allowlist (plus a `site/` line in `.npmignore` as
belt-and-suspenders).

## Develop

```bash
# From repo root:
pnpm install
pnpm site:dev           # http://localhost:4321
```

The dashboard (Next.js, in the parent repo) lives on `:3738` in dev, so
the two can run side by side without port collisions.

## Build & preview

```bash
# From repo root:
pnpm site:build         # outputs to site/dist
pnpm site:preview       # serves site/dist on :4322
```

```

## Internationalisation

- `astro.config.mjs` uses Astro's built-in i18n with
  `defaultLocale: 'en'`, `prefixDefaultLocale: true`. The root `/`
  redirects to `/en/`.
- Short reusable strings live in `src/i18n/ui.ts` (English + 中文).
- Long-form page copy is **inline** per `.astro` file — easier to scan
  one document than to grep across a translation table.
- The `<LangSwitch>` component preserves the current path segment when
  flipping between locales (`/en/cli/` ↔ `/zh/cli/`).

## Theming

- Three-state theme cycler: dark → light → system. Persisted to
  `localStorage` under `ccgauge.site.theme` (prefix `.site.` so it
  doesn't collide with the dashboard's `ccgauge.theme`).
- An inline no-flash `<script>` in `BaseLayout.astro` applies the
  matching `<html class>` before paint.
- CSS variables in `src/styles/global.css` mirror the main dashboard's
  Indigo palette so transitioning between marketing site and product
  feels seamless.

## Images

See [`public/images/README.md`](./public/images/README.md) for:

- the **complete file inventory** (which page uses which screenshot or
  generated card)
- the **AI-generation prompt catalogue** for every `feature-*.webp` and
  `og-*.png`
- the **refresh workflow** for screenshots and OG art

Quickest path when the dashboard UI changed and the marketing screenshots
look stale:

```bash
# From repo root, regenerate dashboard screenshots (Playwright):
pnpm screenshots

# Copy them into the site, then rebuild:
cp docs/screenshots/*.png site/public/images/screenshots/
pnpm site:build
```

To re-generate the legacy placeholder SVGs (rarely needed — the site
ships real WebP / PNG now):

```bash
pnpm site:gen:placeholders
```

## Deploy

Recommended: **Cloudflare Pages**.

- Connect the GitHub repo, keep the build root at the repository root,
  "Build command" = `pnpm install && pnpm site:build`,
  "Output" = `site/dist`.
- DNS the chosen domain (e.g. `ccgauge.dev`) at Cloudflare.
- Update `astro.config.mjs#site` and `src/consts.ts#SITE_URL` to the real
  domain so canonical / OG meta tags are correct.

Alternatives: Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages — all support sub-directory
builds with a one-line config.

## Why this isn't part of the npm package

The npm tarball is ~7 MB and contains only the dashboard + CLI + MCP runtime.
Shipping marketing-site source code and generated artwork would bloat install
times for every user who only wants to run `npx ccgauge`. The Astro build
dependencies live in root `devDependencies`, so they are available to
maintainers without becoming runtime dependencies. The main repo's
`package.json#files` whitelists exactly what publishes; `site/` is not on that
list.
